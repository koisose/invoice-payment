  # Fix Invoice RLS Policy

  1. Problem
    - Current RLS policy tries to match with auth.uid() but users aren't authenticated via Supabase Auth
    - The app uses wallet-based authentication, not Supabase's built-in auth system

  2. Solution
    - Update RLS policies to work with wallet addresses directly
    - Allow creators to manage invoices based on wallet address matching
    - Keep public read access for payment functionality

  3. Security
    - Creators can only manage invoices they created (based on wallet address)
    - Public can read invoices for payment processing
    - No unauthorized access to invoice management

-- Create new policies that work with wallet-based authentication

CREATE POLICY "Public can read invoices for payment"
